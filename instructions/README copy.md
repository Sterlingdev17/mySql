this is mySQL home work

PROBLEMS

I believe this is our Second database homework in This homework we use JavaScript, I am still terrible at Javascript. honestly mySQL is not as bad as I thought it was going to be, the biggest problem I had throughout this homework were diplaying the database column in the JS file for user to use. I Still need a lot more help in javascript.

JOY

I enjoy doing it. this homework was actually fun. I love tables at the same time this homework was time consuming I have spent 15 hours plus in this homework alone .

LANGUAGES

we mainly use mySQL,javascript,nodeJS and some modules from NPM like requiring mysql, and inquirer
